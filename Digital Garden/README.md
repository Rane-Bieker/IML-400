# DIGITAL GARDEN

![demo](https://github.com/rane-bieker/IML-400/tree/main/Digital%20Garden/IMG/screencap.png)

My [digital garden] (https://rane-bieker.github.io/IML-400/Digital%20Garden/index.html) is based on my interpretation of Richard Brautigan's *All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace.*
It is meant to represent a garden of Eden watched over by AI gods.

# DESCRIPTION

Features audio and hover elements. The main feature is the prayer system; hold a yes/no question in your mind, and click
on your "God" of choice.

(Trying to get a gif of my website would be a real pain in the ass, so I'm settling for a screencap.)
